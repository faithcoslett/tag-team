### 1. Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks

- Push database and backend code
- Integrate, ensure our backend/frontend/database connect
- Tidy up the interface

### 2. Tasks Completed: What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom)

#### A. Description of tasks completed
Joshua and Charles pivoted to find a new database package after all SQL ones turned out to be incompatible with web app functionality. They also collaborated to implement and push the initial database code, and shared resources with the team so everyone understood the new database package. Ally helped all other members understand the frontend code. Faith cleaned up the database design, and created the first draft of the Undergraduate Research Day presentation slides and the product demo video. Charles, Joshua, and Faith pushed backend code that integrated the database and frontend. The entire group also met with Ward to practice the presentation.

#### B. Your choice of quantifiable metric(s)
The number of tangible things we have created, which includes database code, backend code, integration code, presentation slides, and a demo video.

### 3. Successes

#### A. What are your accomplishments?
The code for all components have been pushed, and integration has completed to the point of a functioning product. We are also largely prepared for our Undergraduate Research Day presentation.

#### B. What solutions were successful?
The Isar database package for Flutter was successful as a fix to finding out no SQL package worked with our web application. Open communication through a team Discord server also helped keep everyone on track with deadlines, each other's plans, new problems, and sharing resources and advice. Finally, coordinating our code pushes with each other helped to make integration smoother. By pushing frontend, then database, then connecting backend code, we were able to design each part around the previous ones. 

#### C. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
First, we found out our planned SQL Flutter packages would not work for our database, as they were not compatible with our web app. Joshua and Charles went through several possible packages including Hive and Drift, but decided on the Isar system since it was one of the most full-featured ones that work with both android and web applications.

### 4. Roadblocks/Challenges

#### A. Describe the challenges
One challenge was realizing our planned SQL database would not work with our web functionality. This meant we had to find another on short notice, and learn to use the non-SQL database. Managing limited time and busy schedules was also a continued challenge, and meant integration had to be made quickly. 

#### B. Describe how you overcame them
Joshua and Charles worked together on a Discord call to both find a new database package to use, and implement the database code. They also did so again to help with backend code. The calls allowed fast communication and focused work time. Whenever new challenges came up or we made a new update, we also made sure to explain it to the team. This kept everyone on the same page. Joshua and Charles shared tutorials and documentation for the new Isar package, which helped Faith and Ally understand it quickly. Integration was made smoother by each component being pushed after the other instead of all at once, so later steps could be built around the others. Time management was helped by each member taking on a different part of the work that was due while waiting on other dependent components to finish.

#### C. What challenges are still left?
Adding search functionality (which is separate from the implemented tag filtering), cleaning up the interface, and refining our presentation.

#### D. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?
We need no assistance currently, and will come to Ward with questions if needed.

### 5. Changes/Deviation from Plan (if applicable - if not, say so!)
We originally planned to develop the project in phases, with each component being designed independently and pushed in a more basic state before then being improved on in sprints. Time constraints and busy schedules led us to instead move to building each component off each other by pushing a fairly complete version of each, one after the other. This had the benefit of easier integeration, as the database could be built off the frontend and the backend could then connect both directly.
