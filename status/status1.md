### 3. Successes

#### A. What are your accomplishments?

We decided on a framework and language for our project, each gained experience in it, and became familiar with how mentor meetings will go.

#### B. What solutions were successful?

We needed a cross-platform compatible framework for our app, so we chose Flutter and Dart. During a team meeting, we conducted research on several possible choices and landed on Flutter/Dart after finding and sharing resources that showed it could support the functionality needed for our app. 

#### C. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?

We considered Electron as another framework, but decided to go with Flutter since its capabilities and libraries seemed more fit for our app.

### 4. Roadblocks/Challenges

#### A. Describe the challenges

We are all new to using Flutter and Dart, and still have to begin writing the first version of our app.

#### B. Describe how you overcame them

To learn the framework, we asked Ward for advice and also shared resources with each other in our Discord (codelabs, project walkthroughs, and documentation pertaining to our specific project like using SQL with Flutter).

#### C. What challenges are still left?

We still have to begin applying our new framework knowledge by writing the first draft of our app's functions.

#### D. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?

We will be emailing Ward with questions as they come up.
