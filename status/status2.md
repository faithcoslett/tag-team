### 1. Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks
Our goals for this cycle were to each study Flutter/Dart, become familiar with the framework, make sure it works on our machines, and to write our prototype functions.

### 2. Tasks Completed: What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom)

#### A. Description of tasks completed
We have each individually studied Flutter/Dart and have worked through code labs to learn the language. Additionally, Ally has created a branch for her work on the frontend functions and has begun development through the git console. Joshua and Charles have also started collaborating on the database side of things. They made a diagram of the database to plan exactly what we want to store before implementing it, and they have also looked into specific options of which type to use (i.e. Dart has libraries for both mySQL and Google's Firebase).
 

#### B. Your choice of quantifiable metric(s)
The number of tangible things we have created, which is 2: the database diagram, and a frontend branch.

### 3. Successes

#### A. What are your accomplishments?
We've become familiar with the framework and language we had no prior experience in, and made sure it works on our machines. We have also started the implementation process by writing in local repositories and separate branches. Finally, we have solidified what we want the structure of our database to be.


#### B. What solutions were successful?
The official documentation for Flutter/Dart and code labs from external publishers like Exercism worked to quickly get us comfortable with the language. Meeting with Ward also helped us troubleshoot, as we brought several questions up with him. His advice about database libraries and working with git on a console solved what we were stuck on. 


#### C. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
Not applicable, all of our current solutions are working and we have not decided which database package to utilize.

### 4. Roadblocks/Challenges

#### A. Describe the challenges
The main challenge was getting started with implementation, since we have now gotten situated with our framework. This was made more difficult by several of us having unexpectedly crammed schedules, experiencing errors with local setup, and still needing to decide which tools within the framework to use.


#### B. Describe how you overcame them
The busy schedules were overcame by communicating with each other. Letting the team know what we've gotten done and when we were going to be unable to work on the project prevented us from being in the dark about our progress. Local setup issues were also solved by bringing our questions to Ward. 


#### C. What challenges are still left?
We still have to decide which database package to use and push the rough functions for our backend, frontend, and database.


#### D. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?
We do not actively need any help, and we will continue to bring questions to Ward when needed.

### 5. Changes/Deviation from Plan (if applicable - if not, say so!)
Not applicable.


---

### 6. Description of Goals/Plan for Next 3 Weeks
- Decide on the package we want to use for our database
- Begin pushing changes to separate backend, frontend, and database branches that include the rough functions needed for each
